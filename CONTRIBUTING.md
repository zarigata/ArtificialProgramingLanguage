- Git (version control)

### Development Setup

*Coming soon - project in planning phase*

---

## Contribution Process

### 1. Discussion First

Before making significant contributions:
1. Open an issue describing your proposal
2. Discuss with maintainers and community
3. Reach consensus on approach
4. Get approval to proceed

### 2. Design Documents

For major features:
1. Create a design document
2. Include rationale, alternatives, and trade-offs
3. Submit for review
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Get approval before implementation

### 3. Implementation

*Guidelines will be established in Phase 1*

### 4. Testing

*Testing requirements will be defined in Phase 1*

### 5. Documentation

All contributions must include:
- Code documentation (when applicable)
- User-facing documentation
- Examples
- Tests
